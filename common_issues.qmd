## Most common things to look for when you get errors

1. Reading in data

```{r}
data <- read.csv('dataset.csv')
```
* keep everything in a r-studio project
* check for typos
* google for the dataset
* check directory
* use TAB for autofill to help prevent typos


2. Packages


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

df <- cars %>%
  filter
```

* always check for packages
* google the function or obv the error
* remember you can define which package to get function from using ::
